## Introduction

For the computer lab in ASTC01: Astrobiolgy, we use this GitHub repo to work on the report. Don't be scared by the look of this programme or by the code you may encounter. We are going through everything together!

## How to open this code

READ EVERYTHING BEFORE FOLLOWING THE STEPS!

1. Click on the "Launch Binder" Logo on the top of this readme file. It will open a page for you where you can see the binder logo and it starts loading the files. This might take some time especially if you load it the first time. 

2. You are now in the folder with the runfile.ipynb. This is the only file you will need to worry about!
